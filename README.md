# HeroPots
Simple script for automating the creation of hero pots

Creating hero pots on the Eden DAOC freeshard is a tedious and time-consuming process. This script seeks to take some of the skulldugery out of the process by providing some automation of the process.

Note that this script is not legal to be used on the Eden freeshard due to containing loops, conditional logic, and delays. Because of this, it should only be viewed for educational purposes.
