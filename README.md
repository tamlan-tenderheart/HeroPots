# HeroPots
Simple script for automating the creation of hero pots on the Eden DAOC server

Creating hero pots is a tedious and time-consuming process. This simple script seeks to take some of the skullduggery out of the process by providing some automation.

## Requirements:
The script requires that you have the Superior Draughts and Hero Pots on your quickbar and accessible via pressing the corresponding button number.
### Superior Strength Draught on the "1" button
### Superior Fortitude Draught on the "2" button
### Superior Dexterity Draught on the "3" button
### Superior Dexterity Draught on the "4" button
### Superior Might Draught on the "5" button
### Superior Deftness Draught on the "6" button
### Hero pot on the "7" button.

## Usage: 
### To craft potions
 1. Stand near an alchemy table
 2. Target a suitable merchant in-game that sells the required resources to make the potions.
 3. Press the F1 key and enter the number of pots to make
 4. Press Ok and go watch Netflix :)
### To cancel a crafting that is running
 1. Press F1 again. Note that the script will terminate at the completion of the current step; the currently executing step will continue to completion

## Notes: 
 1. Delay times entered are my observations of how long it took to craft the items. Further, I increased the delay by 50% to account
for the worst possible crafting conditions.
 2. AHK must be executed as administrator for it to work

## Disclaimer:
The use of AHK is prohibited on many AOC Freeshards, and on Eden specifically the use of loops, delays, and conditional logic is prohibited.
As this script uses these elements, you should know the terms of service of the freeshard you are playing on and use your discretion
whether or not to use this script.
The author of this script makes no guarantees about the code quality or the legality of the script, and is not responsible for the consequences of
your use of the script, or any damages or losses you sustain as a result of using it.
The code is provided AS-IS and as an instructional tool for writing AHK scripts only.
_You have been warned._
